# smartcard-reader-library

A Contact-Type Smartcard Reader library. This library allows you to communicate with contact-type smartcard without any additional chips. This library supports both T=0 and T=1 protocol.

* This version supports T=1 & T=0 protocol, with 4 MHz clock generated by Arduino UNO Pin 9.
* This sketch contains a modified SoftwareSerial library (Added write 8E2 UART).

Please help improve this library.

Thank you
